## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Component Compatibility Issues**
   - Mitigation: Test each component after installation
   - Fallback: Use alternative Radix UI components directly

2. **Performance Issues with Large Data Sets**
   - Mitigation: Implement virtual scrolling and pagination early
   - Fallback: Server-side filtering and pagination

3. **Mobile Responsiveness Challenges**
   - Mitigation: Test on real devices throughout development
   - Fallback: Use Sheet component as alternative to Dialog on mobile

### Integration Risks
1. **Payment Gateway Integration Delays**
   - Mitigation: Use sandbox environment and mock responses
   - Fallback: Manual payment verification for MVP

2. **WhatsApp API Approval Delays**
   - Mitigation: Start approval process early
   - Fallback: Email notifications as backup

### Resource Risks
1. **Development Timeline Slippage**
   - Mitigation: Prioritize critical features, defer nice-to-haves
   - Fallback: Reduce scope to absolute MVP essentials
