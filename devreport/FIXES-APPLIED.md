# Fixes Applied to HTML Files

## Issue
The index.html and dashboard.html files had broken CSS/JS references.

## Root Cause
- Incorrect file paths (using `/css/` instead of `css/`)
- Missing CSS file references (navigation.css, header.css)
- Missing component CSS files in index.html

## Fixes Applied

### 1. index.html
**Before:** Basic template with incomplete CSS references
**After:**
- Fixed all CSS paths (removed leading `/`)
- Added all necessary component CSS files
- Created a homepage with navigation to all pages and demos
- Added quick links to documentation
- Added stats display showing project completion

### 2. dashboard.html
**Before:** Had `/css/` paths and missing CSS files
**After:**
- Fixed all CSS paths (removed leading `/`)
- Added missing `css/components/navigation.css`
- Added missing `css/components/header.css`
- Fixed JS paths (removed leading `/`)
- Removed reference to non-existent `js/utils/helpers.js`

## File Structure
Both files now correctly reference:

### CSS Files (in order):
1. `css/design-tokens.css` - Design system variables
2. `css/base.css` - Base styles and resets
3. `css/layout.css` - Layout system
4. `css/utilities.css` - Utility classes
5. `css/components/buttons.css` - Button components
6. `css/components/cards.css` - Card components
7. `css/components/badges.css` - Badge components
8. `css/components/avatars.css` - Avatar components
9. `css/components/toasts.css` - Toast notifications
10. `css/components/modals.css` - Modal dialogs
11. `css/components/navigation.css` - Sidebar navigation
12. `css/components/header.css` - Top header bar
13. `css/pages/dashboard.css` - Dashboard-specific styles (dashboard.html only)

### JS Files:
- `js/components/Toast.js` - Toast notification system
- `js/components/Modal.js` - Modal dialog system
- `js/layout/AppShell.js` - App shell layout manager (dashboard.html only)

## Testing
Open the files in a browser:
1. **index.html** - Should show a clean homepage with working navigation
2. **dashboard.html** - Should show the app shell with sidebar and header

## Notes
- All paths are now relative (no leading `/`)
- This works better for local development
- For production, you may want to use absolute paths or a base URL
