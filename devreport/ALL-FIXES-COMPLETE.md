# All HTML File Fixes - Complete Summary

## Overview
Fixed broken file paths in all HTML files across the Developer Report Dashboard project.

## Root Cause
Files were using absolute paths (`/css/`, `/js/`) which don't work properly for local development. Files in subdirectories (like `pages/`) need relative paths to properly reference CSS and JS files.
